# Transformer-Neural-Network

Welcome to the Transformer-Neural-Network project! This repository contains code and resources for building a language translation neural network using Python.

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement a transformer-based neural network for language translation tasks. The implementation follows [CodeEmporium's Transformers from scratch](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTl9hO2Oobd97qfWC40gOSU8C0iu0m2l4&si=AkBTqTZ11RA_Zh89) YouTube playlist.

## Features

- Transformer architecture from scratch
- Language translation (source and target languages to be specified)
- Step-by-step implementation with explanations
